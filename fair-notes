TO START
  fair18: ...
  fair22: ... evicted ack cache

NOW
  priority/fairness
    do end to end test in cloud again!
    extra cache for evicted acks
    cms:
      hybrid should keep top k
      persist top k so reload+grow is better
      do reseeding
      uint32 + overflow
        nextafter: https://go.dev/play/p/eRZuU-paKJH
      ability to handover whole sketch
        cache in external memcache?
        proper handoff?
    taskreader data structures:
      rewrite the eviction loop to go across loaded+acked together?
      switch to btree?
    taskwriter structure without goroutine too (fair14)
    use lists for pollers (fair15)
    dual read!!

    metrics for fairness stuff
    add back dithering
    priority for schedules
    consider manual sharding idea
    eager activity interaction? should do rpc to matching
    oops, passes from different readers are incomparable in primatcher
